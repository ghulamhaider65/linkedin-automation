# 🔍 LinkedIn Job Scraper & Automation Tool

This Python-based automation tool logs into LinkedIn, searches for job listings based on a given keyword, scrapes detailed job data (title, company, location, post date, description, etc.), and saves the results to a CSV file — all while mimicking human behavior to avoid detection.
